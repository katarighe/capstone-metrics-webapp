<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Mini World Atlas <a name="about-project"></a>

**Mini World Atlas** is a React mobile web application that allows users to check a list of metrics (numeric values) retrieved from a selected API called REST countries, where you can get information about countries via a RESTful API.

REST Countries API is a RESTful API that provides information about 200+ countries and territories. It is a free and open-source API, and it does not require an API key. The API is based on the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, and it provides information about a country's name, flag, coat of arms, capital, population, area, borders, currencies, languages, and more.

This project was created as part of the Microverse Full-Stack Web Development Program, which is a 12-month program that teaches students the skills they need to become full-stack web developers. The program includes training on a variety of programming tools, such as React, JSX, CSS, and JavaScript.

The webapp has been deployed to Netlify and is now available for you to try. Click the link below to visit the live demo.
